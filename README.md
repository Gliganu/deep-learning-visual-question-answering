Code written in order to experiment with the VQA (Visual Question Answering) Dataset http://www.visualqa.org/ using Deep Learning Techniques.

The task at hand is given an image and a question about the contents of the image, to be able to create a system which is able to accurately answer that particular question.

This is a very difficult task because it involves merging techniques from Computer Vision & NLP
